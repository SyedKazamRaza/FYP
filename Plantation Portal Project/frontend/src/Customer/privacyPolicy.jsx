              Welcome to the FineLiving. At FineLiving we respect your privacy
              and want to protect your personal information. This Privacy Policy
              explains how we collect, use and (under certain conditions)
              disclose your personal information. This Privacy Policy also
              explains the steps we have taken to secure your personal
              information. Finally, this Privacy Policy explains your options
              regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal
              information. By visiting the Site directly or through another
              site, you accept the practices described in this Policy.

              <li>
                Data protection is a matter of trust and your privacy is
                important to us. We shall therefore only use your name and other
                information which relates to you in the manner set out in this
                Privacy Policy. We will only collect information where it is
                necessary for us to do so and we will only collect information
                if it is relevant to our dealings with you.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will only keep your information for as long as we are either
                required to by law or as is relevant for the purposes for which
                it was collected.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means
                by which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is
                reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the
                purposes for which the personal data was collected, and is no
                longer necessary for any legal or business purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can visit the Site and browse without having to provide
                personal details. During your visit to the Site you remain
                anonymous and at no time can we identify you unless you have an
                account on the Site and log on with your user name and password.
              </li>
              <li>
                We or our authorised service providers may use cookies, web
                beacons, and other similar technologies in connection with your
                use of the Site.
              </li>
              <li>
                The acceptance of cookies is not a requirement for visiting the
                Site. However, we would like to point out that the use of the
                'basket' functionality on the Site and ordering is only possible
                with the activation of cookies. Cookies are small text files
                (typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory
                of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a
                message. They allow us to recognise a particular device or
                browser. Web beacons are small graphic images that may be
                included on the Site. They allow us to count users who have
                viewed these pages so that we can better understand your
                preference and interests. Cookies are tiny text files which
                identify your computer to our server as a unique user when you
                visit certain pages on the Site and they are stored by your
                Internet browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be
                used to recognize your Internet Protocol address, saving you
                time while you are on, or want to enter, the Site. We only use
                cookies for your convenience in using the Site (for example to
                remember who you are when you want to amend your shopping cart
                without having to re-enter your email address) and not for
                obtaining or using any other information about you (for example
                targeted advertising). However, certain cookies are required to
                enable core functionality (such as adding items to your shopping
                basket), so please note that changing and deleting cookies may
                affect the functionality available on the Site. Your browser can
                be set to not accept cookies, but this would restrict your use
                of the Site. Please accept our assurance that our use of cookies
                does not contain any personal or private details and are free
                from viruses.

              <li>
                We have in place appropriate technical and security measures to
                prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to or accidental loss of
                or destruction or damage to your information. When we collect
                data through the Site, we collect your personal details on a
                secure server. We use firewalls on our servers. Our security
                procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of
                identity before we disclose personal information to you. You are
                responsible for protecting against unauthorized access to your
                password and to your computer.
              </li>
              <li>
                You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission
                over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely
                secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to
                protect the security of your information and are constantly
                reviewing and enhancing our information security measures.

                If you are concerned about your data, you have the right to
                request access to the personal data which we may hold or process
                about you. You have the right to require us to correct any
                inaccuracies in your data free of charge. At any stage you also
                have the right to ask us to stop using your personal data for
                direct marketing purposes.

                be bound by this Privacy Policy and take responsibility for his
                or her actions.
